            This paper describes the use of coaching as a means to enhance
            professional development of English‚Äêlanguage teachers in a school
            involved in a partnership project in Hong Kong, which is
            characterised in terms of three phases. While the rationale for
            bringing in coaches into the school is on creating effective
            professional development environments for teachers‚Äîthat is,
            providing ongoing supports and forming a community of practice
            focused on instructional methods, curriculum innovation, and new
            formats for instructional delivery‚Äîafter 18 months of the
            partnership project it was found that the teacher/coach relationship
            is more complicated than expected. The paper will end with
            suggestions on how the three key stakeholders, namely the teachers,
            principal and teacher educators, can co‚Äêconstruct effective
            professional development environments.
