          This paper describes the use of coaching as a means to enhance
          professional development of English‚Äêlanguage teachers in a school
          involved in a partnership project in Hong Kong, which is characterised
          in terms of three phases. While the rationale for bringing in coaches
          into the school is on creating effective professional development
          environments for teachers‚Äîthat is, providing ongoing supports and
          forming a community of practice focused on instructional methods,
          curriculum innovation, and new formats for instructional
          delivery‚Äîafter 18 months of the partnership project it was found that
          the teacher/coach relationship is more complicated than expected. The
          paper will end with suggestions on how the three key stakeholders,
          namely the teachers, principal and teacher educators, can co‚Äêconstruct
          effective professional development environments.
